Prophet Model, Energy Storage Optimization, Solar Curtailment, ESG Alignment, Zero-Carbon Transition
This study addresses the energy resilience challenges faced by Asheville School following Hurricane Helene (2024), during which 8–9 campus buildings lost power despite existing solar infrastructure. We propose a predictive solar-storage framework integrating time-series forecasting, weather-adaptive machine learning, and economic optimization to achieve a zero-carbon campus. Using Facebook’s Prophet model, hourly electricity demand is predicted with an RMSE of 12.8 kWh, while dual Gradient Boosting Regressors (sunny-day =0.91, cloudy-day =0.87) optimize solar generation forecasts based on OpenWeather API inputs. The system reduces curtailment waste by 63% and achieves 42% solar coverage through a 500 kWh Tesla Megapack, yielding a 13.2-year payback period under federal tax incentives. By displacing 18.9 tons of CO₂ annually and aligning with North Carolina’s Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard, this work provides a scalable blueprint for educational institutions to enhance climate resilience, reduce grid dependency, and inspire sustainable infrastructure development in hurricane-prone regions.
